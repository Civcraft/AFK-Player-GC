Comment: default values might be a bit crazy.. They are intended for testing. Change them.


Comment: kick_thresholds field ignores non-numerical characters and only reads three numbers separated, 
Comment: non-numericals are there only to make configuration file more readable.
Comment: Use 0 as an amount of seconds when you don't want to kick people.

kick_thresholds:
  - When 81 to 100 players online kick after 60 seconds
  - When 51 to 80  players online kick after 120 seconds
